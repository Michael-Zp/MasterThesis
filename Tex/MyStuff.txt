Simulation:

- I wont use Knot removal:
    - I is prone to create long control polygons which hinders the movement by tractrix simulation.
    - The results just dont look good and I can control the control polygons enough with just knot insertion.
    - Yes it has a performance impact, but it should be fine I think.
    - What to do?
        -> Keep it in the program and show results with and without it.
    - Ok I fucked the implementation up, it looks ok now ^^
